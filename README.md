# AppsFactory QA Challenge

This is a simple Web Testing Project for Chrome that executes the following Test Case.

"As a new Amazon user, I want to search for the cheapest Snickers and Skittles on the page.

Add the cheapest ones to your Basket and check if the basket calculates the result correctly

Check if on Checkout, without an account, the user gets redirected to the registration page."
